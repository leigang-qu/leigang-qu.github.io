I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [NExT++](https://www.nextcenter.org/), National University of Singapore (NUS), supversied by [Prof. Tat-Seng Chua](https://www.chuatatseng.com/) and mentored by [Wenjie Wang](https://wenjiewwj.github.io/). Before that, I obtained my M.S. degree from Shandong University in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Liqiang Nie](https://liqiangnie.github.io/) and [Prof. Meng Liu](https://mengliu1991.github.io/). 

My research interests lie in Visual Content Generation and Multimodal Large Language Models.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
